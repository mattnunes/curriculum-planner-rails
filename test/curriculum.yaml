  description: "This course is devoted to the elaboration of the Classical Style in the architecture and art of the city of Rome (ca. 1500-1640) and its gradual transformation into the Baroque. Initially we'll study the social organization of the Papal States and the major currents of thought in sixteenth-century Italy, with particular emphasis on the Counter-Reformation and the increasing popularity of the Copernican hypothesis, culminating in Galileo's observations of 1609. \n\nIn architecture we'll review the classical models (mostly ancient Roman); the organization and form of ecclesiastical architecture, tracing developments from the basilica to the Latin cross to idealized visions; Alberti and Brunelleschi; the invention of linear perspective; the Renaissance adoption of Roman models, notably Vitruvius; the dome and the vault, their form, structure, ornamentation, and painting; urban planning strategies, involving the piazza, the obelisk, the church faade, and their inter-relationships; the contributions of Bramante and Michelangelo; the transition to the Baroque; Bernini and Borromini; and anamorphic projections.\n\nIn painting we'll study the development of the Classical Style, especially at the hands of Michelangelo and Raphael; the influence of Florentine Mannerism and the reaction against it; and the creation of the Baroque style and Caravaggio's tenebrism in the early 17th century. \n\nPrerequisites: None.\n\n"

Among the major artists covered will be Piranesi, Greuze, David, Gericault, Ingres, Blake, and Goya. Readings will be drawn primarily from the poets and philosophers of the period, including Coleridge, Wordsworth, Blake, Burke, Kant, Diderot, Rousseau, and Winckelmann. In art, our emphasis will be on the intimate relationship between late Neoclassicism and Romanticism, and on how the Romantic impulse originated in sketchbooks, small paintings, diaries, and other highly personal creations. In both art and literature our principal topics will include the budding interest in spontaneity and chaos; the investigation of and sympathy with madness; the primacy accorded to the erotic impulse; and the fascination with the demonic and the revolutionary.\n\nPrerequisites: None.\n\n"

Fueled by the philosophy of mercantilism, traders followed, and sometimes were, explorers seeking riches in the lands &quot;discovered&quot; in the search for trade routes.20 The resulting contact between cultures led to fundamental transformations of all the societies and cultures involved. Drawing on specific ethnographic examples, this course invites students to embark on a journey of exploration of the globe. Through texts and film we will examine the internal dynamics of selected societies on various continents in order to understand how they construct their world, as well as investigate the dynamics which tie them together in a system of hierarchy established over the course of centuries since the age of European exploration. \n\nPrerequisites: Prior work in anthropology or another social science.\n\n"

Architects and designers are rethinking old models and exploring radical new ones. In the midst of a major shift in the contexts in which residential design is engaged, the dwellings form, performance and even notions of occupancy may be reinterpreted under a new set of parameters. We will examine a range of paradigms for dwelling and building and how these relate to both global and local systemic forces. \n\nUsing the single family residence as a baseline program, students will develop a set of values to serve as praxis for a residential design project that critically responds to a revised program of dwelling, sustainability and environmental responsibility. We will explore a variety of emerging materials and construction methods to see which can offer greater levels of performance, responsiveness and adaptation to the way we will live in houses in the future.\n\nPrerequisites: Familiarity with architectural fundamentals and permission of the instructor. \n\n"

  description: "Over millions of years, communities of plants and animals in the earth's forests have evolved complex systems that enable the forest to recover from environmental change. In New England, native populations of people certainly used the forest and practiced agriculture, but the forest underwent profound changes as a result of extensive clearing of land for farming by European settlers. Today, however, New England is one of the most heavily forested regions of the United States. This course in ecology and evolution addresses organisms in habitat and function of natural systems. We will use the forest ecosystems that dominate Bennington's landscape to develop tools applicable in study of any ecosystem. How has evolution shaped the composition and structure of native tree species? Do herbivores and carnivores shape the plant community or vice versa? How have these systems responded to a history of glaciation, climate change, fire, wind, and agriculture? What are the broader ecological implications of the recent regeneration of our forests? Are forests 'sinks' or 'sources' of greenhouse gases? For anyone interested in how natural systems - plants and animals - work and in thoughtful observation of nature; no prerequisites. The class is appropriate as preparation for more advanced work in biology. Students will work with quantitative data. Lab includes field-work. There will likely be at least one weekend field-trip.\n\nPrerequisites: None.\n\n"

  description: "More than at any other time in the history of human civilization, we can't project where we are heading by looking at where we have been. Why is our time unique? We are already experiencing measurable climate change, and best estimates suggest that, within the next century, the world will experience climates warmer than any since the evolution of humans. Our lifestyles are profoundly dependent on a fossil fuel resource (now about half-depleted), whose combustion is responsible for these changes. Humans population is increasing at a rate that will double current population in a generation, contributing to massively accelerated extinction (perhaps, now, a species every few minutes), wholesale rearrangement of ecosystem function, and regional collapses in productivity of agricultural systems and fisheries. Because these trends and conditions are without precedent, our estimates of trajectories and effects are inherently uncertain. But social and economic structures are embedded in and dependent on these global systems; changes in their dynamics will affect us, potentially in massive ways. What are the likely (or worst-case) consequences for human welfare and futures? Is anticipated climate change a threat to security (national or global, social or economic)? Can democratic institutions respond effectively to long-term threats to the sustainability of human societies? To the uncertainty of our understanding? We will explore the necessary conceptual background, in a variety of fields, to understand issues of global environmental change.\n\nPrerequisites: None."

Although it is possible that the more general, theoretical issues may contribute to ongoing research on identity, the impetus is to suggest contextualized, local reform. \n\nPrerequisites: For First-Year Students.

Examples of this problem include: mercury contamination in fish, which is particularly dangerous to pregnant women and children, arsenic in the drinking water of tens of millions of Bangladeshi rural people, which has caused an entire segment of that nations population to be diseased, and lead contamination in buildings in urban areas of the US. Heavy metals are a natural part of the earths environment, but a number of human actions combined with natural processes can cause them to be transported into peoples food and/or water supplies. \n\nThe Lab:\n\nA complex interplay of geologic and chemical processes control how metals may be transported through natural waterways into food and drinking water sources. This design lab will study the groundwater and surface water pathways that metals travel through, how the chemical speciation of metals controls the level of metal mobility in these pathways, and how to best mitigate the affected food and water supplies. We will use the example of mercury contamination travelling from soils in the Green Mountains into rivers and ponds to study the mobility of metals in natural environments. This will include field monitoring and sampling along waterways, laboratory chemical analysis of collected water and soils, and interpretation of analytical results. \n\nThe Action:\n\nThe class will apply its knowledge of heavy metal transport to address worldwide manifestations of this problem, particularly to regions in which the affected population has no choice but to consume the contaminated food /water. Students will be required to devise and propose operable solutions to these problems, and will be strongly encouraged to purse direct action through FWT projects. \n\nPrerequisites: For First-Year Students.

  description: "The problem:\n\nThe moving image is a powerful and persuasive medium. Most often we experience film and video as passive consumers seeking entertainment and escape. The purpose of this class is to transform the consumerist response to time-based media into a critical production response. The students will research the use of video as a tool for activism and will address current local issues with collaborative video productions. \n\nThe lab:\n\nAs technology becomes more and more accessible video has become a potent tool for social change. This design lab will research the complex intersection between media and action. Students will learn the fundamentals of video production while exploring differences between propaganda and documentary, news, and advocacy. Central to the lab will be regular guest lecturers including producers of independent media, activist groups and advocacy videographers that work with not-for-profits.\n\nThe action:\n\nWorking in groups, students will study the use of video as an activist tool. Screenings of contemporary and historical video combined with reading assignments will inform students approaches to their own video projects.  The students will learn video production skills and collaborate on productions that address social issues and provide media tools for local not-for-profits. The culminating works will be displayed on campus and on the Web.\n\nPrerequisites: For First-Year Students. Upper-Class Students admitted by application."

  description: "The Problem:\n\nOur experience of light is constant and ongoing yet rarely thought about carefully, even though it shapes our perception of our every waking moment. Aesthetic and economic/environmental consequences may result from insufficient knowledge and awareness. How we feel, how everything appears, and how well we are able to address various tasks are all determined in part by light. The production of electricity required for light sources other than daylight has an environmental impact because it comprises a substantial portion of our overall carbon foot print, and the cost to purchase electricity consumed has an obvious economic impact as well. On the other hand, light from the sun has the potential to revolutionize modern societies by providing unlimited clean energy, provided several (serious) technical hurdles can be overcome.\n\nThe Lab:\n\nA series of investigations and experiments from the perspectives of the arts and science to learn how to see and think about light, make qualitative and quantitative assessments regarding light and its impact, critically examine the practical aspects of photovoltaic energy sources, and balance aesthetic, economic and environmental considerations of various lighting options.\n\nThe Action\n\nAt mid-term, each group of participants will identify a specific problem or situation to address in substantial depth, in which light has the potential to positively affect the quality of life and/or well being of an individual or community. Groups will then assess aesthetic, environmental and economic factors, do hands-on experimentation and/or testing as appropriate, and present proposals for action. \n\nPrerequisites: For First-Year Students.

  description: "The Problem:\n\nOne of the urgent problems of our time is the number of at-risk youth around the world regularly recruited into violent conflicts. What are the factors that make this possible? This Design Lab will look at the serious problems facing adolescents in our own community as well as in other cultures. &quot;Sababa&quot; is a word that means &quot;cool&quot;, created by both Israeli and Palestinian adolescent youth. As far as we know, it is the only shared word of its kind that was created by youth from two warring peoples.20 &quot;Sababa&quot; is an example of the spontaneous, hopeful response that is possible when youth are given the opportunity to respond to their conflicts.\n\nThe Lab:\n\nIn this Design Lab, we will be studying the factors involved in growing up and being particularly vulnerable to violent and destructive behaviors. Responses to trauma will be examined and effective strategies for recovery will be explored. We will be meeting with youth from our local community as well as international students from other cultures. We will determine which experiences are particular to our culture and what challenges may be shared by the global adolescent community.\n\nThe Action:\n\nAfter studying and reflecting on the factors contributing to youth violence and recruitment into destructive conflicts, we will be proposing projects that will change this phenomenon both locally and globally. Potential connections to youth in Pakistan, Israel, the Palestinian territories, Haiti, Uganda, India and Northern Ireland will be researched for future exchanges with college and high school students from Bennington.\n\nPrerequisites: For First-Year Students.

In an epic series of ten playsone set in each decade of the twentieth centuryWilson chronicled the complexities of self-creation and vital connection among individuals on the move, as they &quot;search for ways to reconnect, to reassemble, to give clear and luminous meaning to the song which is both a wail and a whelp of joy.&quot; Wilsons unique theatrical voice is simultaneously poetic and musical; his inspirations ranged from blues music to the work of African American visual artists. We will explore the creative artistry and historical context of Wilson's &quot;Century Cycle,&quot; through interdisciplinary readings, film screenings, rigorous expository writing, collaborative projects, and periodic field trips. \n\nPrerequisites: None."

  description: "Over millions of years, communities of plants and animals in the earth's forests have evolved complex systems that enable the forest to recover from environmental change. In New England, native populations of people certainly used the forest and practiced agriculture, but the forest underwent profound changes as a result of extensive clearing of land for farming by European settlers. Today, however, New England is one of the most heavily forested regions of the United States. This course in ecology and evolution addresses organisms in habitat and function of natural systems. We will use the forest ecosystems that dominate Bennington's landscape to develop tools applicable in study of any ecosystem. How has evolution shaped the composition and structure of native tree species? Do herbivores and carnivores shape the plant community or vice versa? How have these systems responded to a history of glaciation, climate change, fire, wind, and agriculture? What are the broader ecological implications of the recent regeneration of our forests? Are forests 'sinks' or 'sources' of greenhouse gases? For anyone interested in how natural systems - plants and animals - work and in thoughtful observation of nature; no prerequisites. The class is appropriate as preparation for more advanced work in biology. Students will work with quantitative data. Lab includes field-work.

  description: "More than at any other time in the history of human civilization, we can't project where we are heading by looking at where we have been. Why is our time unique? We are already experiencing measurable climate change, and best estimates suggest that, within the next century, the world will experience climates warmer than any since the evolution of humans. Our lifestyles are profoundly dependent on a fossil fuel resource (now about half-depleted), whose combustion is responsible for these changes. Humans population is increasing at a rate that will double current population in a generation, contributing to massively accelerated extinction (perhaps, now, a species every few minutes), wholesale rearrangement of ecosystem function, and regional collapses in productivity of agricultural systems and fisheries. Because these trends and conditions are without precedent, our estimates of trajectories and effects are inherently uncertain. But social and economic structures are embedded in and dependent on these global systems; changes in their dynamics will affect us, potentially in massive ways. What are the likely (or worst-case) consequences for human welfare and futures? Is anticipated climate change a threat to security (national or global, social or economic)? Can democratic institutions respond effectively to long-term threats to the sustainability of human societies? To the uncertainty of our understanding? We will explore the necessary conceptual background, in a variety of fields, to understand issues of global environmental change.\n\nPrerequisites: None.\n\n"

Under the leadership of Vladimir Lenin, the Bolsheviks established the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. We examine Russia 'from tsars to commissars,' drawing upon English-language primary and secondary sources including works of art, music, poetry, literature, and political thought. Topics include: tsarist Russia, serfdom, anti-tsarist movements, WWI, Marxist-Leninist thought, the Bolshevik Revolution, Bolshevik culture, Lenin in power, relations with the US, the Communist International, Stalin in power, the gulag system, WW2, the Cold War, and post-Cold War Russia.

To explore frame and focus on a small scale, we will view and discuss images of the small, diorama-like boxes created by artist Joseph Cornell. On a large scale, we will look at some historical examples of theater forms, such as Greek, Roman, Renaissance, Elizabethan and contemporary, to identify how these architectural types differently frame and focus the performances housed within. In between, we will look at how various windows around campus frame our views/focus on the campus landscapes. \n\nStudents are also expected to attend one lecture, performance, or event outside of regularly scheduled class time.\n\nPrerequisites: None.\n\n"

  description: "In the early 20th century, mathematicians learned to stop worrying (if they ever did) about what mathematical objects are and to focus instead on what they do. This process-distilling experience to formal rules and then studying the consequences of the rules in the abstract-has been immensely fruitful and has been reflected outside of mathematics. The interplay between formal systems and concrete intuition is one of the main creative tensions in modern mathematics, and yet, this dichotomy is hopelessly muddled in standard high school curricula. We will study this process, focusing on two examples in detail: common algebra, and logarithms. In this module you will learn to reason and do proofs as they are done in modern mathematics, but on a more concrete level, you will get a better understanding of algebra, logarithms, and apparently arbitrary mysteries like &quot;negative times negative gives positive.&quot; There are no prerequisites for this class; it is appropriate for students who are uncomfortable with mathematics. Students who want a similar but more intensive experience might consider taking Logical Reasoning instead.\n\nPrerequisites: None."

Along the way, musical Americana gets reconstructed into a surreal theatrical collage. Rehearsals will develop the work through experimental techniques including Viewpoints, as well as dedicated music rehearsals. Performers must be willing to sing, act, and move. The work will be performed in the first month of Spring 2010 term.\n\nPrerequisites: Audition. Check moodle.bennington.edu and click on &quot;Border Towns&quot; for more info."

In this course, we'll look mainly at 16th-century composers of counterpoint, and sing through pieces from Palestrina to Weelkes, while learning to compose in a variety of practices such as canons, the motet, and familiar style. We'll gradually work our way from two-voice to four-voice counterpoint, and set texts in a variety of harmonic styles. Emphasis will be placed on creative work, and student pieces will be performed in class throughout the term. Students must be able to read music fluently.\n\nPrerequisites: None."

To help secure any of the myriad forms of institutional support including funding, venues, and engagements, artists must develop, creatively and flexibly, essential skills. Finding a public language for what is the private process of creation is an art in itself.20 Furthermore, understanding and discovering ways to adapt to changing economic realities is a critical component of making work; bringing the work into the world is a natural part of the artist's process. \n\nThis course addresses basic issues involved in generating, developing, producing, and presenting art work. Students will write artist statements, press releases, biographical statements, resumes, c.v.'s, grants and cover letters; will prepare budgets, will organize promotional portfolios/videotapes; will interview each other; and will give short lecture demonstrations.\n\nPrerequisites: Advanced level work in one of the art forms.

How de we understand and respond to color from philosophical, phenomenological and cultural vantage points? How as artists can we become the master of our passionately-loved and yet ever-shifting chroma?\n\nIn this class, we look carefully at and discuss the work of many artists and the implications of color in their images. Readings from Goethe, Wittgenstein, Baudelaire, Albers, Batchelor and others serve as a base for discussion and artistic response.\n\nVisual work using a variety of materials including cut paper, water-based paint and mixed-media will be the primary focus of the class. In addition, reading assignments as well as written responses will be assigned weekly.20 Class time is primarily used for discussion and critique, presentations and demonstration of materials.

Hence developing an understanding of the basic relationships between states, markets, individuals and the civil societies in which they function is an essential basis for understanding international relations, international political economy, and conflict resolution. How do individuals organise to provide for their wants and needs? Do economic relationships define society? What is the role of the state in structuring and regulating markets? What should it be? Is there a natural progression of stages of economic development in a society? What is the relationship between social class, politics, and managing the economy? How is the identity of individuals, societies, and states constituted? What is the relationship between identity and markets? The course will survey major theoretical approaches from classical political economy (Adam Smith, Ricardo, List, Marx, Lenin) to 20th century critics of market society (Gramsci, Polanyi), neorealism (Gilpin), neoliberalism (Krasner), structuralism (Wallerstein, Strange), post-positivism (Harvey, Steve Smith) and social constructivism.\n\nPrerequisites: None.\n\n"

  description: "Since the early 1990s, a wave of democratization has swept the African continent, leading to the unraveling of previously authoritarian (one-party, military, and/or strongman) political regimes. The transition to democracy has unfolded unevenly across the continent, however. Some countries (Benin, Ghana and Mali, for example) have witnessed significant progress towards the institutionalization or consolidation of democratic government. A number of other countries (Cote DIvoire, Democratic Republic of Congo, Angola) have experienced the dramatic recession, collapse or breakdown of democratization. Several other African countries (Nigeria, Ethiopia, Kenya, Uganda) are drifting ambiguously and precariously in their democratic journey. This course focuses on the democratization project as it has unfolded in Africa. Assignments and readings will explore African democratization in theoretical and comparative perspective, transitions from authoritarianism, elections, the roles of domestic civil society and the international community, the impact of democratization on governance, democracys prospects, and illustrative country case studies. \n\nPrerequisites: None."

It also examines the American mass medias portrayal of the regions peoples and cultures in order to test the claim that the orientalist stereotypes of Arabs and Muslims have so widely influenced U. S. public opinion that popular images of Middle Easterners have become uniformly threatening. The course will begin with an exploration of how the outcome of W.W. I brought the U. S. into the center of great-power rivalry over the political fate of the Middle East and then moves on to explain how by the end of W.W. II the geopolitical orientation of the region came to be seen as vital to American national security. Today, the paradox of American power in the Middle East lies in the fact that it is20 most ostentatious in causing shock and awe, but ineffective in accomplishing its goals. Thus policy makers and academic experts are engaged in an ongoing debate over the ends and means of how Washington can meet the complex challenges facing it in the Middle East. The required readings for the course will represent diverse perspectives on this historic debate and students are expected to become familiar with the assumptions and norms that inform the competing views. In our discussion of the weekly readings students should feel free to raise any question they wish, but the assigned readings must remain the constant referent of our conversation.\n\nPrerequisites: One year of work in Social Science or permission of the instructor.\n\n"

The paraphernalia associated with mastering a foreign language - explicit grammar sessions, vocabulary, oral and aural practice, text - will be on offer, but it will generally be student-driven, servicing the content, corroborating the hope that in confronting our own preconceived notions of the Spanish-speaking world we will simultaneously debunk those regarding how a language is taught.

Studying the female condition in Italy and its inscription in womens narratives, students will discover what connects a courtesan of the XVI century (Veronica Franco), a revolutionary aristocrat of the XVIII (Eleonora de Fonseca Pimentel), feminists of the XX century (Sibilla Aleramo, Dacia Maraini, and Oriana Fallaci), and post-feminists of our time (Margaret Mazzantini and Simona Vinci). Students will focus on narrative structures and get acquainted with the different styles from various epochs. They will also undertake narrative writing. Through in-class analysis and discussion of primary texts, students will further improve their speaking skills in Italian. The course is conducted in Italian.

  description: |-
    Humans can be defined as thinkers and as knowers of language, but it is in discourse that thinking and
    language intersect. At this intersection, we can see that thinking is not simply a private, mental phenomenon,
    but is enabled and constrained, supported or blocked in discourse as speakers engage in their practical and
    intellectual activities. In this course we make connections between discourse and thinking within ordinary
    communicative activities and trace the influence and impact of discourse on the activities and products of
    thinking. Throughout the course, students gather discourse data on thinking within ordinary talk, classrooms,
    and other contexts. Students draw on several discourse analytic tools rooted in the social sciences, especially
    linguistics and sociology, to make sense of their data.
