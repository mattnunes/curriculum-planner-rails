In art, our emphasis will be on the intimate relationship between late Neoclassicism and Romanticism, and on how the Romantic impulse originated in sketchbooks, small paintings, diaries, and other highly personal creations.

The class is structured around a series of projects where rigorous experimentation is encouraged.<br /><br />Students will learn various non-typical printmaking methods through a straightforward format of demonstrations of techniques, hands-on experience, and critiques. Techniques will include monotype, polyester laser plates, and20 various transfer techniques. Additionally, we will explore the possibilities of 3-dimentional applications for prints. This can include anything from books, paper cups, matchbooks, modular installations, appropriated prints and wallpapers.

Our lifestyles are profoundly dependent on a fossil fuel resource (now about half-depleted), whose combustion is responsible for these changes. Humans population is increasing at a rate that will double current population in a generation, contributing to massively accelerated extinction (perhaps, now, a species every few minutes), wholesale rearrangement of ecosystem function, and regional collapses in productivity of agricultural systems and fisheries. Because these trends and conditions are without precedent, our estimates of trajectories and effects are inherently uncertain.

At this intersection, we can see that thinking is is not simply a private, mental phenomenon, but is enabled and constrained, supported or blocked in discourse as speakers engage in their practical and intellectual activities.20 In this course we make connections between discourse and thinking within ordinary communicative activities and trace the influence and impact of discourse on the activities and products of thinking. Throughout the course, students gather discourse data on thinking within in ordinary talk, classrooms, and other contexts. Students draw on several discourse analytic tools rooted in the social sciences, especially linguistics and sociology, to make sense of their data.\n\nPrerequisites: None.', 'Peter Jones', 'FLE', 'M 4:10 - 6pm, M 6:30 - 8:20pm', '--- \n- dtend: \n - 18\n - 0\n dtstart: \n - 16\n - 10\n byday: \n - MO\n- dtend: \n - 20\n - 20\n dtstart: \n - 18\n - 30\n byday: \n - MO\n', 'Discourse and Thinking', '2010-09-13 01:22:00')

In New England, native populations of people certainly used the forest and practiced agriculture, but the forest underwent profound changes as a result of extensive clearing of land for farming by European settlers. Today, however, New England is one of the most heavily forested regions of the United States. This course in ecology and evolution addresses organisms in habitat and function of natural systems. We will use the forest ecosystems that dominate Bennington\'s landscape to develop tools applicable in study of any ecosystem. How has evolution shaped the composition and structure of native tree species? Do herbivores and carnivores shape the plant community or vice versa? How have these systems responded to a history of glaciation, climate change, fire, wind, and agriculture? What are the broader ecological implications of the recent regeneration of our forests? Are forests \'sinks\' or \'sources\' of greenhouse gases? For anyone interested in how natural systems - plants and animals - work and in thoughtful observation of nature; no prerequisites.

Why is our time unique? We are already experiencing measurable climate change, and best estimates suggest that, within the next century, the world will experience climates warmer than any since the evolution of humans. Our lifestyles are profoundly dependent on a fossil fuel resource (now about half-depleted), whose combustion is responsible for these changes. Humans population is increasing at a rate that will double current population in a generation, contributing to massively accelerated extinction (perhaps, now, a species every few minutes), wholesale rearrangement of ecosystem function, and regional collapses in productivity of agricultural systems and fisheries. Because these trends and conditions are without precedent, our estimates of trajectories and effects are inherently uncertain. But social and economic structures are embedded in and dependent on these global systems; changes in their dynamics will affect us, potentially in massive ways. What are the likely (or worst-case) consequences for human welfare and futures? Is anticipated climate change a threat to security (national or global, social or economic)?

Examples of this problem include: mercury contamination in fish, which is particularly dangerous to pregnant women and children, arsenic in the drinking water of tens of millions of Bangladeshi rural people, which has caused an entire segment of that nations population to be diseased, and lead contamination in buildings in urban areas of the US. Heavy metals are a natural part of the earths environment, but a number of human actions combined with natural processes can cause them to be transported into peoples food and/or water supplies. \n\nThe Lab:\n\nA complex interplay of geologic and chemical processes control how metals may be transported through natural waterways into food and drinking water sources. This design lab will study the groundwater and surface water pathways that metals travel through, how the chemical speciation of metals controls the level of metal mobility in these pathways, and how to best mitigate the affected food and water supplies. We will use the example of mercury contamination travelling from soils in the Green Mountains into rivers and ponds to study the mobility of metals in natural environments. This will include field monitoring and sampling along waterways, laboratory chemical analysis of collected water and soils, and interpretation of analytical results. \n\nThe Action:\n\nThe class will apply its knowledge of heavy metal transport to address worldwide manifestations of this problem, particularly to regions in which the affected population has no choice but to consume the contaminated food /water.

This first set of questions will explore when and how interviewees use technology and when and how they don\'tfor school and personal life. For example, how do they use the web-based information services provided by the College? What works, what20 doesn\'t and why?

On the other hand, light from the sun has the potential to revolutionize modern societies by providing unlimited clean energy, provided several (serious) technical hurdles can be overcome.\n\nThe Lab:\n\nA series of investigations and experiments from the perspectives of the arts and science to learn how to see and think about light, make qualitative and quantitative assessments regarding light and its impact, critically examine the practical aspects of photovoltaic energy sources, and balance aesthetic, economic and environmental considerations of various lighting options.\n\nThe Action\n\nAt mid-term, each group of participants will identify a specific problem or situation to address in substantial depth, in which light has the potential to positively affect the quality of life and/or well being of an individual or community.

Why is our time unique? We are already experiencing measurable climate change, and best estimates suggest that, within the next century, the world will experience climates warmer than any since the evolution of humans. Our lifestyles are profoundly dependent on a fossil fuel resource (now about half-depleted), whose combustion is responsible for these changes. Humans population is increasing at a rate that will double current population in a generation, contributing to massively accelerated extinction (perhaps, now, a species every few minutes), wholesale rearrangement of ecosystem function, and regional collapses in productivity of agricultural systems and fisheries. Because these trends and conditions are without precedent, our estimates of trajectories and effects are inherently uncertain. But social and economic structures are embedded in and dependent on these global systems; changes in their dynamics will affect us, potentially in massive ways. What are the likely (or worst-case) consequences for human welfare and futures? Is anticipated climate change a threat to security (national or global, social or economic)?

There are no prerequisites. The class is suitable for students whose mathematical background is weak, but it is recommended for everyone who will be using mathematics in their work. It will be a prerequisite or at least strongly recommended for all quantitative mathematics classes, including modeling, calculus and linear algebra.
